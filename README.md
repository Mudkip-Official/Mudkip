# Mudkip

**Mudkip** is a React library for building typesafe headless forms. Soon, **Mudkip** will not only work with Typescript, but also with Zod! We are also currently working on Yup support as well, though even when it is production-ready, Zod will still be recommended. In the (hopefully) near future, we hope to add Joi support as well!
